# DeepFakeChallenge
### W251 Deep Learning in the Cloud and at the Edge (Spring 2020) Final Project

## Abstract

* Participate in the Deepfake Detection Challenge (Kaggle)
* Use IBM Cloud for pipeline
* Report findings/results

## Introduction

Deepfake techniques enable a realistic AI-generated videos of people doing and saying fictional things. The technology lies within the field of computer vision, a subfield of computer science and it is not something new, as we have seen similar crude methods of photo manipulation (a.k.a, "photoshopping") before. The term "deepfakes" was believed to be originated around the end of 2017 in a Reddit community r/deepfakes by a Reddit user named "deepfakes". Perhaps an example below would ring a bell.

Popularized by the various swaps of Nicholas Cage's face, the technology makes its mainstream debut in January 2018 as a proprietary desktop application called "FakeApp", which then gets superseded by Faceswap. The rising interest in DeepFake was not only supported by the amateur/commercial development efforts, but also supported by the academic institutions as a group of reserachers from University of California, Berkeley have published a paper in August 2018 that expands the application of deepfakes to an entire body. 

Initial reactions to Deepfake techniques have been worriesome as these realistic fake videos have the potential to significantly impact how people determine the legitimacy of information presented online. As a result, AWS, Facebook, Microsoft, the Partnership on AI's Media Integrity Steering Committee, and academics have collaborated to launch a DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) on Kaggle, in order to promote collaboration and contribute to an effort to build a robust response to the emerging threat of Deepfakes.
